<a></a><br>The Chairback Mountains of the 100 Mile Wilderness are the closest I come to quitting the trail. As my terror over the rugged heights of Maine slowly fades over the next 24 hours, I review my fears.<br><br>There are the heights: the boulders of Katahdin, the rock slides of the Chairbacks, and the promise of worse to come. The threat of weather: I shudder to think of the wind knocking me off my feet on an exposed ridge. The sheer overwhelming realization that despite all the distance I’ve walked, nearly a thousand miles still remain.<br><br>I can still picture myself bouncing down a mountainside and into a valley.<br><a></a><br><em>Again, not how physics works,</em> I tell myself.<br><a></a><br>I remind myself that I <em>chose</em> to be here to push myself to my mental and physical limits. There is joy and opportunity for growth in taking on a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, then conquering it, step by step. I made my decision to hike in a perfectly rational state of mind; my current fears are not rational, and I decide that I will not yield to them. Not today.<br><a></a><br>And so, I do not quit.<br><a></a><br>Instead, I look up videos of the terrain on the trail. Mt. Madison. Wildcat D. The Mahoosucs. My breath quickens just watching other people climb up precipitous rock scrambles, but I watch the videos over and over again, hoping that they will prepare me for the upcoming terrain.<br><a></a><br>I enjoy spending time with my family. Mom and I explore Bangor, ME before traveling to North Conway, NH. My cousin, aunt, and uncle rent a house for the week, and we join them there.<br>

<a></a><br>On a whim, I head to Pinkham Notch, one gateway to the Presidential Range in the White Mountains. The weather for the next few days looks beautiful.<br><a></a><br>“What is the weather in the Presidentials like in late September?” I ask one of the staff. Even as I speak, I know it’s an unreasonable question. The weather can turn on a dime; Mt. Washington is known for having some of the worst weather in the world. Snow can occur any month of the year.<br><a></a><br>He tells me there could be snow in September.<br><a></a><br>“I’m thru-hiking, and considering hiking the Presidentials now while the weather’s good,” I tell him.<br><a></a><br>“Well, you could always do them now, and if the weather’s good when you get here, you could do them again!”<br><a></a><br>I privately think there is little chance I will want to do the Presidentials twice, but I decide to hike up the Presidentials tomorrow, when the forecast looks good, rather than risk poor weather a month later.<br>
