<a></a><br>Tenacious, Nighthawk, and I hike over Old Blue and Bemis Mountain on our first day after leaving The Cabin. Maine serves up more of the typical Maine terrain: slippery slabs, muddy trail, and tangly roots. Old Blue isn't so bad. Wild blueberries still grow at these higher elevations, and every so often, I stoop to pick a few berries to keep myself motivated after a climb. Once, I pass another hiker holding a small plastic bag full of fresh-picked wild blueberries. The berries are small, less than half the size of store bought blueberries, with a certain tartness accompanying their sweet flavor.<br>

<a></a><br>Halfway through the day, I run into Wandering Star, whom I'd met in the 100 Mile Wilderness.<br><a></a><br>"How funny!" she exclaims.<br><a></a><br>We catch up for a few minutes; she tells me that a couple other flip-floppers, Atlas and Jeni, are somewhere behind. Wandering Star asks me to pass on a message for them: "Tell them they should be ashamed of themselves that they couldn't keep up with Wandering Star!"<br><a></a><br>

<br>Bemis Second Peak is beautiful, though the descent is steeper than anticipated. I get into camp at 6:45 pm. Nighthawk has amassed a considerable pile of sticks. As Tenacious and I set up our tents, she starts a fire. By the time we finish setting up, the sun has set.<br><a></a><br>Daylight seems so short now, compared to the long hours of sunlight we enjoyed in Virginia.

<a></a><br>I hike past Atlas and Jeni the following day.<br><br>"Wandering Star says hi!" I tell them. Then, I awkwardly add, "She also said you should be ashamed of yourselves for not keeping up with her."<br><a></a><br>From our campsite to Rangeley, the terrain evens out. <em>Is this even Maine?!</em> I find myself wondering.<br><a></a><br>When I reach the parking lot to Rangeley, I find a wooden post pointing in the direction of The Hiker Hut, where we will stay the night. I start down the road in that direction.<br><br>

<a></a><br>"Do you want a ride?" a couple calls from a car as they drive by.<br><br>"It's not very far, but sure!"<br><a></a><br>The Hiker Hut is an off-the-grid series of cabins on the outskirts of Rangeley. There is a privy, bunk house, kitchen, and outdoor shower by the side of a stream. Several private cabins are also available, each with a different theme. Tenacious arrives a few minutes after me.<br><a></a><br>"They have a chipmunk that comes out and eats from your hand!" Nighthawk shouts from the bunk house porch. She has a handful of nuts in her outstretched hand. As I watch, a small chipmunk scampers over, pauses, and snatches a nut from her.<br><a></a><br>The owners laugh, introducing themselves as Steve and Catherine.<br>

<a></a><br>Steve brings me fresh towels for the shower. "It's an outdoor shower."<br><br>"Woah, that's so cool!" I say as Nighthawk explains how the shower works.<br><br>"I love your attitude - all three of you," Catherine says, smiling. "So many of our guests -- outdoor shower: What?! No cell service: What?! No electricity: What?!"<br><br>The outdoor shower heats water from a large barrel of stream water. A chair and umbrella are situated nearby. As I shower, rain begins to fall, the cold droplets mixing in with the hot water. How interesting! Afterwards, I switch off the heater, clothe myself, and refill the barrel with water.<br>

<a></a><br>After the three of us finish cleaning up, Steve takes us to town. First stop: the outfitter. Tenacious' old shoes have delaminated, and she spends an hour picking out a new pair of Oboz from the limited selection of shoes at the outfitter. Maine has not been kind to our gear. Nighthawk's pack has more holes than I can count in the mesh pockets. I had to get new hiking poles after Maine took an inch off my old ones.<br><a></a><br>We eat a hasty dinner at the local pub. Then, it's time to resupply. As Nighthawk and I wait for Tenacious, she spots a temporary tatto vending machine.<br><a></a><br>"Do you have any quarters?"<br><br>I hand over a few.<br><br>"Thanks!" She plunks the quarters in and pushes. A flaming skull tattoo pops out.<br><br>"That'll scare your mom!" I say, laughing.<br>
