Over the next few days, thoughts about how to end my Appalachian adventure loom, unbidden, in my mind. On a rare day with phone signal, my parents and I talk about meeting&nbsp;for my last week on the trail.<br><br>"When?" Mom asks.<br><br>I don't know. Do I end my adventure after 30 days, or stay longer? If I stay longer, should I focus on ramping up my mileage to hike through all of Virginia, or take time to enjoy my journey near its end?<br><br>"How about you give me a few days to think on it?" I propose.<br><br>

Before leaving Maupin Fields Shelter, I unfold my map to trace the Appalachian Trail winding from the Three Ridges, across the Tye River, and up The Priest. A red dotted line meets the trail by the shelter, bypassing the Three Ridges and rejoining the trail a few miles before the river: a blue-blazed shortcut called the Mau-Har Trail. Woody declared his intentions to take the shortcut last night; Shweasle already set out down the trail earlier that day. Intrigued, I follow their lead.<br><br>A sign precedes the trail, warning, "The Mau-Har Trail is a tough, rugged, 3-mile trail, with lots of ups and downs. It requires the same stamina and energy as the 6.2-mile shelter to shelter hike up and over the top of Three Ridges."<br><br><em>Hmm. Interesting.</em>

The Mau-Har Trail runs along several creeks, passing by small waterfalls and pools. I enjoy the variety of wildflowers thriving along the edges of the path, though many sections are rockier and less well-maintained than what I've experienced so far.<br><br>By lunchtime, I reach the Tye River. Happily, I heave my pack onto a slab of rock, dig out a bag of granola, and sit down to eat. As I look across the river, I see Shweasle emerge from behind a tree. He waves, then stoops to gather water.

With only four miles left until the next shelter, I anticipate an easy afternoon. I completely underestimate the time required to climb The Priest: a 4,000 foot mountain requiring 3,000 feet of ascent.<br><br><em>Just put one foot in front of the other</em>, I tell myself. The woods engulf me, obscuring any view of the mountain ahead. I have no idea how far I am from the summit. <em>Keep going</em>. Sweat drips from my forehead as I watch streams of northbound hikers bound past me down the mountain. <em>Just like life</em>, I think, as my pace slows to a crawl. <em>Slogging through challenges is just a part of life. Think about what it'll feel like to reach the summit.</em>

Another northbounder passes by.<br><br>"Is that the summit?" I call, pointing to the highest point I can see in the distance.<br><br>He whirls around. "No, you've still got a ways to go."<br><br>I continue hiking up the relentless uphill, focusing on each small step forwards, until --<br><br>After nearly four hours, I crest a hill and see the trail plateau before me: Triumph!<br><br><em>Life is just like climbing mountains</em>, I think to myself. <em>The way isn't always clear - especially at the beginning of the road, the foot of the mountain - but the farther I climb, the harder I work, the more I see.</em>

I unclip my pack as I reach The Priest Shelter, located on a clearing near the summit. I am the first to arrive for the night, though I see a group of weekend campers setting up tents across the field. I busy myself with camp chores: inflating my sleeping pad, drawing water, and cooking dinner.<br><br>As I return from the small stream next to the shelter, picking my way through swampy patches of land, my foot sinks into the soft, squishy mud. I can't help but laugh: I changed into my flip flops as soon as I arrived. <em>Next time, check the lay of the land before switching shoes</em><em>!</em><br>An hour later, Woody and Phlatlander stroll in, looking just as relieved to reach the shelter as I felt after the long climb.<br><br>Phlatlander pulls out a can of Coke and Dr. Pepper. "Want one?"<br><br>"Wow, thanks!"<br><br>The soda tastes unexpectedly good after a long day of climbing.<br><br><em>One day from my next mail drop</em>, I think as I fall asleep. <em>One day from a hot shower and real food.</em>
