<br><font size="3">I awake to the steady pitter-patter of rain against my tent.</font><em> <br><br>Time</em> <font size="3"><em>to get up,</em> I repeat to myself for the umpteenth time. <em>You have to keep moving</em>; <em>staying put will get you nowhere.</em> <em>It's raining now - nothing you do will change that - but one day, the sun will come out.</em> <em>That's for sure</em>. <br><br>Slowly, I roll out of my sleeping bag and begin to break camp: I let the air out of my sleeping pad, stuff all my belongings into their respective sacks, and tie up the tent. 2 1/2 hours. In a couple weeks, perhaps, I'll get that down to 1.</font>

<br>I quickly get used to the rain. Fog blankets the valleys below. Through gaps in the trees, I glimpse snatches of wintry half-barren mountainsides. Further along the trail, golden buds and small flower blossoms herald spring.<em> I hope spring shows up in the Shenandoahs</em>, I think.<br><br>

<br>By midday, the sun breaks through the clouds.<br><br>

<br>I hike on, battling exhaustion by the end of the day, wondering what new trials dawn will bring.<br><br>
