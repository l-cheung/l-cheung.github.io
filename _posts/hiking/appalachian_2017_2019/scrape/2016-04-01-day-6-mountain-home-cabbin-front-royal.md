<br>5 miles: I only need to hike 5 miles. Today, though, my feet begin to bother me almost immediately after I lace my boots.<br><br>&nbsp;<em>Remember why you're here. Overcome the challenges. Cultivate flexibility. Develop resilience,</em>&nbsp; I tell myself. Even so, when I see a flat, sofa-like boulder by the road after 2 miles, I rush over to tear off my boots and air out my feet for a minute.&nbsp;<em> My boots are killing me,</em>&nbsp; I think, sliding out of my pack.&nbsp;<em> How can I make this work? </em><br><br>I scan the outside of my pack, where I attached several carabiners to the straps. Various odds and ends dangle there: a whistle with a compass and thermometer, my Halfapp trail angels wristband, the outer jacket I shed in the heat, and bright pink flip flops.<br><br>Flip flops!<br><br>I unhook my flip flops, tie my boots onto the carabiner, and slip the flip flops onto my feet. I begin hiking a bit awkwardly at first, but the terrain is gentle, and my toes have enough room to expand.<br><br>Prior to leaving for the trail, I packed multiple mail drops: boxes of food and supplies to send to myself along the way. Today, I plan to stay at a hiker hostel, the 'Mountain Home Cabbin,' and pick up my first mail drop.

A few dozen yards from the trail, a gravel driveway bears the sign "Mountain Home Cabbin | Bed and Breakfast." I catch sight of two buildings as I head up the driveway. The first is small, brick, and nondescript, more the size of a shed than a house at first glance. Tibetan prayer flags line the doorway. The second, a large, white plantation house with Greek columns at the entrance, overlooks the entire estate.<br><br>Though I see several cars, no one appears to be on the property. For a moment, I hesitate. Then, a woman pops her head out the window of the plantation house.<br><br>"You must be Lilian!" she calls.<br><br>"Yes," I shout back.<br><br>"I'm Lisa. Go ahead on upstairs. I'll be there shortly." She gestures at the small brick building.<br><br>Upstairs? For a second, I wonder how such a tiny-looking building could fit two stories. Then, I shrug off my pack, leave my boots, flip flops, and poles in the entryway, and open the screen door to go inside.<br><br>I step into a small, cozy kitchen. A partition runs down the middle of the room; two beds are crammed into the other half. To my right, a staircase leads up to a small square room filled with four beds and a bathroom in one corner.<br><br>After hauling my pack upstairs and onto one of the beds, I wait all of ten minutes before the desire to shower away days of dirt and grime overcomes me.<br>

<br>Lisa is not yet there when I finish. I head downstairs. A book propped on the kitchen table details her husband and son's journey on the Appalachian Trail. As I flip through the pages, admiring the photos, Lisa enters.<br><br>"I took a shower. I hope you don't mind," I say.<br><br>"Oh, no, that's what you're supposed to do. Make yourself at home. Do you want some lemonade?"<br><br>"Ooh, yes, please."<br><br>"So you need to go to town for laundry and the post office," Lisa says, taking out a plastic cup.<br><br>"Yes, please. Oh, and are there any places in town to get new boots? Mine are too small."<br><br>Lisa turns out to be one of the most gracious hosts I've had the pleasure of meeting. She shuttles me to town not once, but twice: once to lunch and Walmart for new boots, and a second time for laundry and mail - I pack my old boots to mail home in between.<br><br>At Walmart, I try on at least ten pairs of shoes before I find one in the men's shoes section wide enough to accommodate my flattened toes: In the past four days, my feet have grown from a women's 7 to a men's 8.5.

<br>Once we're back at the Mountain Home, Lisa treats me to a tour of the plantation house. "My husband, Scott, had a lot of time to think on his thru-hike," she tells me. "When we decided to open a hostel, we looked everywhere for places close to the trail. The realtor kept sending us listings for places, but they were all far away - more than a couple miles from the trail. When we told her that, she said, 'well, there's always Mountain Home.' Right now, it's just the cabin, but we're working on restoring the house."<br>

<br>Layers of plaster and half-finished paint line the walls of the plantation house. White cloth covers the hallways.<br><br>"I was working on painting when you showed up. I don't always dress like this." She gestures at her paint-splattered work pants. Both Lisa and Scott hold day jobs outside of the hostel; Lisa talks excitedly about her work with the EPA. I can hardly imagine how they find time to manage the hostel and renovate the Mountain Home, but part of me thinks,&nbsp; <em>I want to be like that: always working on a project, always following my passions, always trying to achieve my dreams.</em><br>

<br>The history of the house and its old artifacts fascinates me. "We found a bunch of shoes in the attic," Lisa continues. "My son - he's a PhD student in archaeology and anthropology - tells me they were put there to ward off unfriendly spirits." Rounding a corner, we step out onto the balcony and watch as the sun sets over the mountainside. I look forward to a good night's sleep.<br>

<blockquote>"What are some of the hardest lessons in life?"

"Hmm. I think it's different for different people. The decisions you make now will have an impact many years later... For me, probably the hardest lesson was that I can't be in control of everything in life."

- Lisa, owner of the 'Mountain Home Cabbin'</blockquote>
