<span>Get up. Brush. Eat. Pack. The mornings have solidified into a routine.<br><br>"There's no water at Thunder Hill Shelter," one of the northbound hikers said the day before. "There's an unmarked spring 0.3 miles off trail. I drew a map of how to get there in the logbook."<br><br>Thunder Hill Shelter is my destination today.</span><br><span></span>

<span>My dad's words from weeks ago float incongruously to the surface of my mind. "You need mental stimulation."</span><br><br><span><em>Face your challenges and work through them,</em> I think. <em>Mental and physical challenge lead to growth; growth leads to the milestones of success. </em>Besides, overcoming challenges and emerging in triumph is infinitely more satisfying than coasting along in life.</span>

<span>As Phlatlander and I hike up a hill, a familiar voice yells at us from a campsite off trail: Shweasle. He reclines against a rock, wearing a plaid gray kilt, looking like he had just awoken at noon.<br><br>"There were about twelve whippoorwills here last night," he shouts. "Didn't get any sleep! I don't know who it was who said 'the lonesome cry of the whippoorwill,' but 'lonesome,' doesn't even come close to describing it! 'Cheerful,' or 'overly enthusiastic,' maybe. I mean, had that guy even heard a whippoorwill before?!"</span>

<span>Phlatlander and Shweasle hike ahead. When I reach Thunder Hill Shelter, I spot Phlatlander hanging her clothes out to dry on Rhododendron branches.<span>&nbsp;</span><br><br>"Hey!" she says. "There's a Mountain Dew waiting for you!"<br><br>"What?!"<br><br>"Someone left Mountain Dew in the shelter."<br><br>"Someone left figs, too, if you want some. We just opened a pack," Shweasle adds, without looking up from his phone.<br><br>"I found the spring," Phlatlander continues. "I got 5 liters of water, so that's 2.5 for each of us."<br><br>"Thanks! You're awesome!" I'm again struck by the level of interdependence along the trail.<br><br>After examining a rather large blister that looks as though it gave birth to a baby blister underneath, I head over to enjoy the Mountain Dew and figs. The three of us study our trail guides, aware of the need to resupply soon. Just a day's walk away is a campground; we plan to head there the next day.</span>
