Shweasle and Phlatlander arrive in town early that morning. We resupply in town, and pick out some choice bites - apples, cinnamon, caramel - to pack out for dinner the next night. That afternoon, we get a hold of Woody via Facebook.<br><br>Beth, Woody's wife and a former electrical engineer, picks us up for dinner at the Three Lil' Pigs.<br><br>That night, enjoying the complementary hikers' pudding and surrounded by our ragtag group of southbound hikers, I cannot stop smiling.
