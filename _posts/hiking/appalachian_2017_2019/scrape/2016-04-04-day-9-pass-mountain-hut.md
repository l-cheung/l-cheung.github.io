<br>Phlatlander leaves the shelter early in the morning, aiming for an 18 mile hike into Bird's Nest Hut. I follow shortly afterwards. Within a couple minutes, Turtle Catcher surpasses me as I stop to adjust my gloves. <br>

<br>"Guess you've caught your first turtle," I joke.<br><br>Though I am not yet ready to hike 18 miles, I feel a slight improvement in my hiking. My feet still ache, but less than before.

<br>Towards midday, I begin hiking down a hill towards Elkwallow Gap. Suddenly, I hear the leaves rustle to my left. I turn towards the sound, expecting to see squirrels or birds.<br><br>Bears.<br><br>I freeze. Two bears: a momma bear and its cub. They look smaller than I expect. After a second, the cub begins playfully scurrying around its mother.<br><br>The momma bear stands rigid, staring steadily at me.<br><br><em>Ok. Avoid eye contact.&nbsp;</em> I tell myself. <em>I'll just go about my business and they'll go about theirs. I doubt they want a confrontation any more than I do.</em><br><br>As I edge around the bears, eyes averted, I manage to snap a picture on my iPhone.<br><br>After walking another few hundred feet, I glance back. No bears. Good. <br>

<br>Exhaustion begins to set in around mid afternoon. By now, I know I can handle it. As I take a break and consider finding a spot to tent, I check for a signal on my phone.<br><br>A text message arrives from Lisa: a forecast for snow and freezing temperatures.<br><br>Refusing to spend another sleepless night shivering in my sleeping bag, I choose to push on.<br><br>That night, I head to Pass Mountain shelter. Two section hikers and three thru hikers who started the trail in the Shenandoahs share the shelter with me; Woody walks in just before hiker's midnight.<br><br>"So what do you think of the trail so far?" Adam, one of the section hikers, asks. Both of us stand at the bear box, brushing our teeth.<br><br>"It's one of the most challenging things I've ever done. Sometimes, it's not fun. But it's worth it."<br><br>Reflecting back on the day, I feel that hiking through the mountains is an analogy for life: from youth, every lesson learned, every challenge conquered, is a mountain climbed. To get to where I want to go, I must choose to keep going, to keep pushing past exhaustion and frustration. There is no other choice, just as I had little choice but to push for the shelter today. Time never stops.<br><br>
