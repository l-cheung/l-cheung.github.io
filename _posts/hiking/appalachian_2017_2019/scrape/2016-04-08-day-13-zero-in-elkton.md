<br>I spend the next day in the motel, writing postcards, eating leftovers, and generally relaxing.<br><br>As I watch reruns on TV, basking in the familiar comforts of modern life, part of me can't help but think,&nbsp; <em>there must be more to life than this</em>.&nbsp; Though I yearn for the hot showers, real food, and creature comforts of town, part of me itches to get back on the trail.<br><br>
