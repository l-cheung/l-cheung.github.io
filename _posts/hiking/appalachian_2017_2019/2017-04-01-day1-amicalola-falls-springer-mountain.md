The 8.8 mile Approach Trail leads from Amicalola Falls to Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Three hikers and I share the shuttle to Amicalola Falls, while the rest of the group heads to the Springer Mountain parking lot.

Ray, our shuttle driver, unscrews the top of his Smart water bottle. "These Smart water bottles are really useful," he says. "If you have one with one of these caps, you can use it to flush out your Sawyer filter."

"Where can I get one of those caps?" I ask.

"This one's for sale for $300," he jokes, handing it to me.

I hook my pack onto the pack scale, note down the weight, and pass through the entrance arch. Amicalola Falls cascades down before me. *Breathtaking*, I think. Local hikers mingle with backpackers. I pass by a man hauling several pounds of photography gear, snapping close-up shots of the falls. 9 miles and 600 steps later, I summit Springer Mountain and head to Springer Mountain Shelter.

A couple hikers are already there: John, a former Peace Corps member and art major who now works in software, and Chris, an analyst.
