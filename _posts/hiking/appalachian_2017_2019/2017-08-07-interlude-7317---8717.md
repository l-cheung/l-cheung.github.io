<a></a><br>The doctor diagnoses me with plantar fasciitis and metatarsalgia. No broken bones, though.<br><br>A week later, I attempt to return to the trail and meet Tenacious and Nighthawk near Delaware Water Gap. After 5 miles, I again find myself limping, my speed reduced to a mile an hour. Every step is excruciating.

<a></a><br>I go home again, as determined to avoid long-term injury to my feet as I am to finish the trail.<br>

<a></a><br>I book a lean-to at Katahdin Stream Campground for August 9, and decide to flip-flop: I will hike back to Pennsylvania from Maine to finish the trail.<br><br>It takes 3 weeks for me to stop limping around the house. Another 2 for the plantar fasciitis to fade. Then, I'm back on the AT.<br><br>
