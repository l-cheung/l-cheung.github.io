'I was thinking of parking at Devil's Fork Gap and hiking south to meet you,' Woody texts me.

'That would work!' I text back.

Devil's Fork Gap. Just 9 miles away. On this rare clear day, I spend nearly an hour perched atop the peak of Big Butt Mountain - someone had fun naming the thing - basking in the warm glow of early morning sunlight. The fields and ridges of Tennessee are just visible above the treetops to one side; to the other are those of North Carolina. I just want to stay here, I think. But it would be poor form to meet Woody here, after just two miles.

Less than a mile later, we deposit our permits in the hiker registration box by the Smoky Mountains sign.
