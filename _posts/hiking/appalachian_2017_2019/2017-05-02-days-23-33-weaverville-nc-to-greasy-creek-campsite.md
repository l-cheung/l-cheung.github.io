There is a brief roadwalk from the Fontana Hilton, across the dam, and into the surrounding woods before the official start of the Smoky Mountains. 

"I wonder what it would be like to grow up in this town," Silas says as we cross. "They must hear so many dam jokes."

"One of the locals said she was 7 when the Dam was built. She said she was one of the Dam kids. She went to the Dam school."

>"The first night, I caught, like, five fireflies. I put them all in my bug net, and put that in my tent, and I was like, 'Ah ~ this is magical!'"

Less than a mile later, we deposit our permits in the hiker registration box by the Smoky Mountains sign.
