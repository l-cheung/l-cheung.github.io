# Lilian's AT Blog
---

From 2016-2019, I wrote a series of blog posts on hiking the Appalachian Trail. These posts were originally hosted on Weebly. Later, I migrated the blog to GitHub Pages by automating the process of generating markdown posts with Python and Selenium. The GitHub Pages version was developed using the Mediumish Jekyll Theme.
